## Question

## Answer

Adding HTMX for CRUD Operations
Enqueue HTMX Script: Use wp_enqueue_script in your plugin to include HTMX. Hook this function to admin_enqueue_scripts and specify a condition to only load on your plugin's pages.

Custom Table: Use register_activation_hook to run a function that utilizes $wpdb->query() to create a custom table in the WordPress database upon plugin activation.

HTMX Attributes: In your plugin's admin page HTML, use HTMX-specific attributes (hx-get, hx-post, etc.) to handle CRUD operations asynchronously.

Adding Tailwind CSS Without Conflicts
Scoped Styles: Build your Tailwind CSS with a custom prefix or scope your styles using a unique class on your plugin's admin page wrapper to avoid conflicts.

Conditional Enqueue: Similar to HTMX, use wp_enqueue_style within an admin_enqueue_scripts action hook, with a condition to only load Tailwind CSS on your plugin's admin pages.

Integrating AlpineJS
Enqueue AlpineJS: Use wp_enqueue_script to include AlpineJS, similarly hooked to admin_enqueue_scripts with a condition for loading only on your plugin's pages.

No Conflict: AlpineJS should naturally not conflict with WordPress admin or other plugins, as it activates only on elements with x-data attributes. Ensure it's only enqueued on your plugin's pages to limit its scope.

By following these steps, you ensure that HTMX, Tailwind CSS, and AlpineJS are only used within the context of your plugin, minimizing the risk of conflicts with WordPress core or other plugins.
